# SPI Slave with Single-Port RAM â€“ Basys3 FPGA Implementation

##  Overview

This repository presents a modular SPI Slave design integrated with a single-port RAM, implemented on the Basys3 FPGA development board. The project includes Verilog source code, simulation scripts, constraint files, and detailed documentation. It is suitable for academic, research, and practical digital systems applications.


##  Repository Structure

##  Getting Started

### Simulation

1. Launch ModelSim  
2. Load `project2_tb.v` and execute the `run.do` script  
3. Observe SPI transactions and RAM behavior in the waveform viewer  

### FPGA Implementation

1. Create a new Vivado project  
2. Add `project2.v`, `SPI.v`, `RAM.v`, and `Constraints_basys3.xdc` to the project  
3. Run synthesis and implementation, then generate the bitstream file  
4. Program the Basys3 FPGA board with the generated bitstream
